# E-Banking Project (Early Stage)

This is the initial version of the **frontend part** of the **E-Banking** project, intended to work with the **microservices-based** [E-Banking application](https://github.com/mmihailovic/E-Banking). Currently, a two microfrontends are integrated using **Module Federation**, with the frontend built in **React + TypeScript**, state management via **Redux**, and **UI5 Web Components** for UI elements.

## Current Status

- Two microfrontends are integrated and functional.  
- Basic UI is set up using UI5 Web Components.  

## Development Roadmap

1. **Add New Functionalities**
   - Implement components for remaining e-banking features.

2. **Improve design**
   - Improve CSS styling for better layout and spacing.

3. **Add Another Microfrontend**
   - Create and integrate a microfrontend for stock trading.
